# * INTRODUCTION
A simple outro written in C++ using the SDL2 as a graphic library and thefatrat song. The code is quite messy because I watched many tutorial and copy,paste,edit them everywhere.This is a linux version(Ubuntu 22.04) so you can't run it on macOS or Windows.
INSTALL
Just type ./a.out to run the game. If you want to change any thing in my code, here is the command line to recompile:
g++ *.cpp -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image -lSDL2_ttf -lSDL2_mixer
is the name of the file you want to compile
